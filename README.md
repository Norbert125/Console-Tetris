Made as first year CS student, for fun and to learn, hope you like my little game!
Go in the cmake-build-debug folder and run the my_tetris.exe and the game will open up in your console!
To move the pieces use the arrow keys and to rotate them use the Z and X keys to rotate clockwise and counter-clockwise.
Have fun :3
